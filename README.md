# machineLearningFindBestProject
 algorithm to find the best set of xes and ys to use for a given linear regression or SVM classifier.

 This repo is a project I have been working on since I started the machine learning class taught by Dr. Hoot at nwmsu.
 I have made an algorithm that will perform classifiers and record metrics for all possibilities of x and ys in a dataset. It also has the functionality to find the best set of ys for a given x or set of xes. 

 The driver file is a text based program that asks the user which dataset they would like to use from a list of datasets. They then set up the algorithm in the way they like and the program returns the best classifer for the given settings.

 I belive this algorithm has the capibility of making it easier to pick the features that will yeild the highest result for a given dataset. This could lead to users finding better classifiers than they could by guessing and using intuition. 

 Right now only the linear classifer and svm classifer work. I hope to implement other classifiers over the school year that is starting.

 As of now I am not focused on this work as I have started my next semester. This concept is currently only working for very specific conditions but it helped me out at the time I was making it. I hope to one day return to this and make it better.
